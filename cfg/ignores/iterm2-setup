# These are utilities that the setup/download-iterm2-utils script will
# download and install so they don't need to be in the repo.  This
# file is also used to populate the list of utilities for that script
# to download, so that they don't have to be listed in two different
# places
#
# IMPORTANT: If you edit this file directly you have to run `cfg
# ignore` to update the "real" gitignore file that git actually uses!
