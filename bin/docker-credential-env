# docker-credential-env
# 2018 - Jason Kohles
#
# This is a very basic Docker credential helper that uses environment
# variables to authenticate to Docker.  It's not as secure as the
# other credential helpers that Docker provides, but it can be very
# helpful in some circumstances (such as when using it with Jenkins).
#
# To set this up, install this script somewhere in the Jenkins users
# path (it needs to be named `docker-credential-env`), then add this
# to ~/.docker/config.json:
#   { "credsStore": "env" }
#
# To use it, you need to have the following environment variables set:
# DOCKER_REGISTRY - Your registry URL
# DOCKER_CREDS_USR - Your username
# DOCKER_CREDS_PSW - Your password
#
# If you are using Jenkins Declarative Pipeline, you can do this in
# the environment section of your Jenkinsfile:
#
#   pipeline {
#     environment {
#       DOCKER_REGISTRY = 'https://my-docker-registry.example.com'
#       DOCKER_CREDS = credentials( 'my-docker-credentials' )
#     }
#   }
